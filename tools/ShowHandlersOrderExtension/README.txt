Welcome to ShowHandlersOrder.

This Visual Studio extension shows the order of all handlers in a given handler chain.
To use it, open the ShowHandlersOrder.vsix and follow prompts to install the extension.

In a solution where there are handlers/pipes that inherit from HandlerBase or IPipe right
click a handler/pipe and select "Show Handlers Order" or "Show Pipes Order". This will
show a window with the handlers/pipes in the order they are executed.
